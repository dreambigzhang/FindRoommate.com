# FindRoommate.com

Constantly studying your choices using machine learning, FindRoommate.com can recommend roommates that best suits your criteria!

We used **HTML, CSS and JavaScript** for the frontend, **Flask** to respond to requests and call Python script, **PyTorch** in the backend to perform **Mini-batch Gradient Descent** machine learning on user selection to recommend compatible profiles.

Currently considering using classification instead of regression in the backend
Considering using the Gale Shapley algorithm

This program was created for the HackedED2023 hackathon.
