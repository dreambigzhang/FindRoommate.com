I am an artist that dabbles in most things but mostly do nsfw digital art! Commissions Are OPEN (https://t.co/lKI6rZB3ZA) 
Hi there! I'm an adventurous person who loves to travel and try new things. In my free time, you can find me hiking, dancing, or trying out a new restaurant. I'm also a huge fan of cozy nights in with good company and a glass of wine. Bonus points if you can keep up with me on the dance floor! Looking for someone to join me in renting an apartment.
Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world. I took the midnight train going anywhere - just kidding, I'm actually a city dweller who loves the fast pace and bright lights. I'm a bit of a foodie and love trying out new restaurants, but I also enjoy a good Netflix binge session. Looking for someone to join me on my journey and make every day an adventure.
Hey there! I'm a clean and considerate individual looking for a roommate to share a place with. I work a 9-5 job and enjoy spending my free time exploring the city, trying out new fitness classes, and cooking delicious meals. I'm respectful of others' space and privacy, and looking for someone who values cleanliness and open communication. If you're interested in sharing an apartment or house, let's connect!
